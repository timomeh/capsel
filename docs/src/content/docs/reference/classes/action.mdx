description: Understanding Actions in Vla's architecture

Actions are entry points to your data layer. They're invoked from your framework's route handlers, server actions, or API endpoints.

```ts
class CreatePost extends Vla.Action {
  posts = this.inject(PostService)

  async handle(title: string, content: string) {
    return this.posts.create({ title, content })
  }
}

// Invoke from your framework
const post = await CreatePost.invoke("Hello", "World")
```

## When to use

- Entry points for user requests
- Server actions
- API handlers

## Scope

`transient` (new instance per invocation)
