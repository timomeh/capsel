description: Understanding Services in Vla's architecture

Services contain your business logic. They orchestrate between repositories, other services, and facades.

```ts
class PostService extends Vla.Service {
  repo = this.inject(PostRepo)
  session = this.inject(SessionService)

  async create(data: PostData) {
    const currentUser = await this.session.currentUser()

    if (!currentUser.canPost) {
      throw new Error('Unauthorized')
    }

    return this.repo.create({
      ...data,
      authorId: currentUser.id
    })
  }
}
```

## When to use

- Business logic
- validation
- authorization
- orchestration

## Scope

`invoke` (shared within a request)
